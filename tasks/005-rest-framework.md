# Django REST Framework

I want to add Django REST Framework to this project. Please install it, do the
necessary setup, and add it to CLAUDE.md.

Also:

- create an empty `serializers.py` module in `tx`; update the project
structure of CLAUDE.md to reflect this.
- add the API browser to the the views
